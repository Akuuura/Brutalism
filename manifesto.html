                <div class="principle-number">01</div>
                <div class="principle-content">
                    <h3>THE GRID IS A SUGGESTION, NOT A LAW</h3>
                    <p>Swiss design gave us the grid—a beautiful, mathematical system for organizing information. But a grid is meant to serve communication, not constrain it. We use the grid as a starting point, then deliberately break it to create tension, movement, and emotion.</p>
                    <div class="principle-quote">
                        "Order without rigidity. Structure without sterility."

                <div class="principle-content">
                    <h3>IMPERFECTION IS AUTHENTICITY</h3>
                    <p>In a world of computer-perfect layouts, the human touch becomes revolutionary. Degradation, distortion, and "mistakes" are not errors—they're signatures of authentic creation. The photocopy artifact, the halftone pattern, the slightly misaligned element: these are marks of humanity in design.</p>
                    <div class="principle-quote">
                        "Perfect is boring. Perfect is inhuman. Perfect is impossible."
                    </div>

                <div class="principle-number">03</div>
                <div class="principle-content">
                    <h3>TYPOGRAPHY SHOULD SHOUT, WHISPER, AND SCREAM</h3>
                    <p>Type is not neutral. Type carries emotion, attitude, and personality. We deconstruct letterforms not to destroy meaning, but to amplify it. We layer, fragment, and distort because sometimes visual chaos communicates more honestly than perfect clarity.</p>
                    <div class="principle-quote">
                        "When type becomes texture, communication transcends words."

                <div class="principle-content">
                    <h3>COLOR IS EMOTION, NOT DECORATION</h3>
                    <p>We reject the neutrality of black, white, and gray as the only "professional" palette. Pink clashes with green. Yellow screams against cyan. These conflicts aren't accidents—they're intentional provocations that demand attention and evoke feeling.</p>
                    <div class="principle-quote">
                        "Use color like a weapon, not a garnish."

                    <h3>DESIGN IS POLITICAL</h3>
                    <p>To reject corporate perfection is to reject corporate control. To embrace DIY aesthetics is to reclaim the means of production. To make ugly beautiful is to question who decides what beauty is. Every design choice is a political statement.</p>
                    <div class="principle-quote">
                        "There is no neutral design. There is only deliberate or unconscious."

                    <h3>KNOW THE RULES BEFORE YOU BREAK THEM</h3>
                    <p>This is not ignorance disguised as rebellion. This is mastery choosing liberation. We studied Helvetica before we deconstructed it. We understood the grid before we shattered it. Punk without knowledge is just noise. Punk with knowledge is revolution.</p>
                    <div class="principle-quote">
                        "True rebellion requires understanding what you're rebelling against."

                    <h3>EVERY "MISTAKE" MUST BE INTENTIONAL</h3>
                    <p>There's a vast difference between carelessness and calculated chaos. Every overlapping element, every clashing color, every "illegible" word placement is a deliberate choice. Controlled chaos is still controlled. The appearance of accident requires the most careful planning.</p>
                    <div class="principle-quote">
                        "Chaos is cheap. Controlled chaos is craft."

                    <h3>CHALLENGE YOUR AUDIENCE</h3>
                    <p>Not all design should be instantly accessible. Sometimes the viewer should work to decode the message. Sometimes confusion is the point. If design only confirms what people already know, it teaches nothing.</p>
                    <div class="principle-quote">
                        "Comfort is the enemy of growth."

                    <h3>ANALOG SOUL IN A DIGITAL WORLD</h3>
                    <p>Digital tools are powerful, but they shouldn't erase the human hand. Scan that physical collage. Embrace the scanner artifact. Let the pixelation show. The imperfections of analog processes remind us that design is made by people, for people.</p>
                    <div class="principle-quote">
                        "Technology is the tool. Humanity is the message."

                    <h3>NEVER STOP QUESTIONING</h3>
                    <p>The moment a movement becomes dogma, it dies. The moment rebellion becomes formula, it's no longer rebellion. Swiss Punk isn't a style to copy—it's an attitude to adopt. Question everything, including these principles.</p>
                    <div class="principle-quote">
